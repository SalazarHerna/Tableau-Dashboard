# Tableau-Dashboard
This project explores the economic, healthcare, and consumer price impacts of COVID-19 using interactive dashboards built with Tableau. It combines multiple datasets to provide a multi-dimensional view of unemployment, inflation, stock market activity, COVID-19 case counts, and regional impacts across the U.S. and globally.
