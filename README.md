# Tableau-Dashboard
This project explores the economic, healthcare, and consumer price impacts of COVID-19 using interactive dashboards built with Tableau. It combines multiple datasets to provide a multi-dimensional view of unemployment, inflation, stock market activity, COVID-19 case counts, and regional impacts across the U.S. and globally.

Tools Used
- **Tableau**: For all data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV**: For data preprocessing before import
